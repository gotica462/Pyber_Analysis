# Pyber_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

The CEO of Pyber, a ride-sharing service, has ask us to use our Python skills and knowledge of Pandas to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type to analyse the differences in total drivers, total rides, total fares and fare's average. We are going to be looking at three types of cities: Urban, Suburban and Rural.

## Results

After merging our ride_data cvs and our city_data cvs we can use the group by function to get the total of rides, total of drivers, total fares, average fare per ride	and average fare per driver for each type of city.  See the link below for the code.
