# Pyber_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

The CEO of Pyber, a ride-sharing service, has ask us to use our Python skills and knowledge of Pandas to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type to analyse the differences in total drivers, total rides, total fares and fare's average. We are going to be looking at three types of cities: Urban, Suburban and Rural.

## Results

After merging our ride_data cvs and our city_data cvs we can use the group by function to get the total of rides, total of drivers, total fares, average fare per ride	and average fare per driver for each type of city.  See the link below for the code.

Here are our results:

As expected the total drivers and total rides are significantly greater in the Urban areas, but the drivers in the rural areas earn more money per ride. We canconclude that peope use the Pyber service less in rural areas but they travel longest distances and therefore earn more money, but the chances of making money in rural and suburban areas is significantly less than in urban areas based on the total number of rides. Fianlly we can see there is more competition in the urban areas.

See the line graph below to see the fares for each city over time from January to April
